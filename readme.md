PathPlistsAddUserUid.sh is a collection of bash functions created to help increase the power of CreateUserPkg. They rely on a minimal number of additional commands (PlistBuddy, grep, sed and optionally logger) to ensure functionality within the restricted environments of most inital OS X installations.
